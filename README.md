🇮🇳 Project BharatGDP: Machine Learning Forecasting India’s Economic Future (1960–2030)

📘 Overview
Project BharatGDP is a Machine Learning + Power BI–driven analytical project that forecasts India’s sector-wise GDP composition (1960–2030).
It combines Python-based regression modeling and interactive Power BI visualization to illustrate India’s transition from an agriculture-led to a service-driven economy — and to forecast its future trajectory.

🧠 Objective
To analyze and forecast India’s GDP sector composition using machine learning models, and visualize the results through Power BI for deeper insights.

⚙️ Technical Approach
Model Used: Polynomial Regression (degree = 3)
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
Visualization Tool: Microsoft Power BI
Data Source: World Bank, IMF, RBI (1960–2023 historical data)

📊 Key Steps
Data Cleaning & Preparation
Combined historical GDP data from multiple reliable sources.
Selected core sectors: Agriculture, Industry, Manufacturing, Services.
Machine Learning Forecasting
Used Polynomial Regression to predict GDP shares for 2024–2030.
Achieved Model Accuracy: 99.3% (R²)
Visualization (Power BI Dashboard)

Created multi-page dashboard:
Page 1: Intro
Page 2: India’s Economic Evolution (1960–2030)
Page 3: Key Insights & Outlook

Forecast Output (2024–2030)
Services → 55%+ of total GDP by 2030
Agriculture → <18%, indicating saturation
Manufacturing → gradual growth under Make in India
Industry → stable contribution

💼 Key Insights
India’s economy continues to evolve into a service-led, data-driven system,
where technology, innovation, and digital transformation are redefining growth.
Machine Learning doesn’t just study trends — it helps us forecast the future.
